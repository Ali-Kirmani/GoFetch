The busyness of modern life can make it difficult for most people to find a community and if you’re a responsible dog owner you know that it is a big time commitment. On average taking care of a dog takes about an hour or more out of every day. We propose developing an app that focuses on community building around dog ownership. If you move to a new city, just got a dog, or are looking to make more dog owning friends to go on weekly walks with, then our users could use our app to find appropriately matching dog’s and owner’s in their area. The initial work of finding a new community can seem like a daunting task when initially confronted with it. But we hope to ease the initial work involved in community relations for our users.

Our sign up process is very simple, it is like signing up in any other site. Simply provide the required information and you are set. A full name, email, password and date of birth (make sure you are over 18). Currently our upload images button is under development. Once you are successfully finished filling out the first page, the second pages asks for your dog information. Lastly add some fun stuff in the 3rd page, anything about you, your dog, tags to describe you or your dog, anything!
    -We did not have a fully functioning database to actually keep track of the given information, so given information is not actually saved. However the tags 

Once the user has logged in, users are directed to the main screen. In this screen, users have access to many other screens!

Firstly we would like to showcase the sidebar view, this can be accessed from clicking the top-left "hamburger". Users are treated viewing the user profile, as well as viewing the dog profiles, currently the add dog function is under development, but we would love to iintrotduce this function in reference to our task-examples of a user having multiple dogs. From the sidebar, users are also treated to the setting page, from this we have different accesses to change of information, once again we don't have a database top fully take information in, but the idea for this screen is to have users be able to change information, delete account, etc...

Back again into the main screen, this can be accessed by clicking the bottom "heart" icon. From many other screens, we are able to actually access two other important functions, the messages screen and the view profile screen. To access the messages screen, users should click on the bottom left "e-mail" icon. This will direct users to the inbox screen, in which users are able to see the people they are matched with. The matches screen will direct the user to empty chat messages. Otherwise previously messaged matches will appear under the "inbox" container.

The view profile, which is incorporated in the bottom icon in many of the main screens that involve this navigation. Views the users profile, from here they are able to edit the presented information. Users are also able to edit tags, remove tags, etc. To edit a dog profile that can be found in the side bar view under your profiles.

In the main screen, users are able to view the other users dog profile, the 3 bottons near the middle of the screen beside the users names will direct to the report, block, and unmatch button.
